#### Personal Development Plan

My strong points:
1.	I’m a natural leader. I like to know how everyone is doing, if 
everyone is keeping on track and if not, why is someone slacking?
2.	I keep my promises. If I say I will do something, I do it. 

What are two of your weaker points?
1.	I’m a bit of a control freak. Sometimes I find it hard to let other people do things and to mind my own business. 
2.	I’m competitive. This can be a good thing, because I’m very passionate and really give it 100% if I like something, but it can also lead to hurt feelings when I’m not paying attention.

##### G - Goal
I want to improve on letting other people handle things that I actually want to do myself. I also want to improve my programming and am aiming to not make it a competition, but to really make it a group project. This is important, because you almost never work alone in software developing, which is what I want to do after the studies. 
    
##### R - Reality (Your current situation)
I’ve already been working on my teamwork skills since high school. I had a subject that had only projects. I’ve also worked with Scrum before, which really helps you focus on your development without letting your project out of sight. I’m better at working together and listening to tips than I was before. 

##### O - Options (Look at possible options)
Actively watching myself and letting my teammates know that they need to be clear with me if they don’t like something I say or do are the best ways for me to improve. I would rather improve by myself, but for my goals it is better to let my team guide me. It’s about teamwork after all.

##### W - Will (Motivation, plan of action)
I’m just going to keep working on myself and hope my teammates will work with me. It also helps to work in different teams to get a much more diverse experience. Every team is different, so I’m just going to wait what this team will bring me and how I will have to adjust myself to make the team efficient.

##### G - Goal
My goal with this project is most of all to be able to efficiently work with a group of people. This is important to me because  I have not worked on a (development) project with a (big) group of people before. I believe I have succeeded in this goal when our project is finished and we have got a passing grade.

##### R - Reality
With this project I am already setting the first step towards reaching my goal, as we have already started working as a group. 

##### O - Options
The options I have to reach my goal are basically this project, as this is the only big project we will be doing as a team in this year. I want to obviously try to learn as much as I can during this project, especially abour working in a group. The only thing I think would be stopping this is if members of the group had different opinions on how things should be done. but so far everyone is on the same track :D.

##### W - Will
I am going to try my hardest to follow the rules we have set up, and to deliver everything I am supposed to. I will try to do this everytime I get the chance to do so. Right now the first step I can take is to work on this personal development plan, so that I already have my part of what we needed to do finished. My teammates can help me achieve this goal by helping if I have questions or don't understand something/am getting stuck with something.
action plan:
⋅⋅* finish my part of the readme that we have to finish 
⋅⋅* try to keep up with what needs to be done
⋅⋅* don't be hesitant on asking people for help
⋅⋅* deliver things I need to do on time

My strong points:
- I am an ambitious person in order to achieve my goal I can study a lot
- If I have a task and have promised to finish it, I finish it
- These are useful for teamwork because hard work and being aware of responsibilities provide advantages for the project

My weaker points:
- Sometimes I can be a stressed and anxious person. If we have a difficulty about time management etc. I can get stressed. But if we work efficiently as a team, I do not think this is going to be a problem

##### G – Goal
My goals in this project:
- Developing my Java skills
- Learning how to work effectively as a team
- Getting a high grade

I am aiming to successfully finish the parts that belong to me in our project. To achieve this, I should develop my Java skills. I want to contribute to my group and to learn new things from my teammates. When we finish our project, I will be achieved my goal.

##### R – Reality
This is my first team project. I have never experienced this before. I have done some similar programs in different languages but this is the first one in Java. This is both exciting and hard. There are many things I need to do but I like to study and develop myself. 

##### O – Options
There are two options to achieve and not to achieve but I do not want to count the second one as an option because we are a team. And teamwork means that many different perspectives and a lot of human power. Therefore, I can say that there is not any reason for an unsuccessful result. If it happens, it is also not a problem. It shows that I need to develop myself. I would try to learn new things from my mistakes.

##### W – Will
I will try to do my best to be successful in our project and I am going to start right now for this. The first step I can take is creating a plan with my group mates and to start our project according to this plan.

Action Plan:
- Determining the things we have to done
- Deciding important parts as a group (such as which libraries we are going to use etc.)
- Distributing this work equally to team members
- Starting to code (informing each other about the steps we have took)
- While everyone is working on their part, to inform each other about the progress is very important because some parts can be connected. When two people's parts are connected they should act according to that otherwise it can lead problems or a non-compiling code)

 My strong points:
 1. I am observing and think before I speak. 
 2. I like things to be organised and efficient and will work hard to get them that way.

 My weaker points:
 1. I like to do things alone. I rather figure something out myself instead of asking for help, even if this takes way too long.
 2. I tend to stay quiet if I'm not absolutely sure my contribution is right or useful. 

##### G - Goal
My goal during this course is getting more experienced in working with things like github, libraries, scrumboard, etc. and asking for help if I need it, since being stuck on something isn’t going to help my groupmates.
    
##### R - Reality
Every minute that we’re working on the project, I’m also actively working on my goal. 

##### O - Options
By working on the project with the chosen programs, I’ll get more experienced in using them. Using those programs for other projects as well will only improve my knowledge. By being active in the groupchat and during the meetings, asking stuff will be easier. 

##### W - Will
I will reach my goal by working actively together with my teammates using lots of the useful programs given.
